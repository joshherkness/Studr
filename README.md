Add description here.

#### Git Process

Begin by cloning the repository using the command `git clone https://github.com/joshherkness/Studr.git`

1. Create a feature/hot-fix branch using the command `git branch branch-name`.  This name must be describe the feature/hot-fix you intend to work on.  Ex. `database-authentication`, `user-interface`, `st-view-controller`.  

> Note: If you would like to delete the branch simply use the command `git branch -d branch-name`.

2. Regularly commit your changes, and push to your branch.
3. When you have a workng copy of your feature, simply open a pull request on the github website.  The **base** branch should always be *master*, and the **compare** branch should be your branch name, i.e. *branch-name*.
4. Then (if you have editing capabilities on the repository) accept the pull request, and verify your changes.

> Note: The master branch should always be deployable.
